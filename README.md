# iSCSI LUN Mounting Scripts for Proxmox Backup Server

A comprehensive set of Bash scripts for automated iSCSI LUN connection, mounting, and cleanup on Debian 13 systems, specifically designed for Proxmox Backup Server (PBS) datastore configuration. These scripts provide enterprise-grade iSCSI storage management with systemd integration, automatic reconnection monitoring, and complete cleanup capabilities.

## Summary

This repository contains two complementary scripts designed to simplify iSCSI storage management for Proxmox Backup Server environments:

- **`iSCSI_mount.sh`** - Combined connection and mounting script that connects to iSCSI targets with CHAP authentication, automatically detects the new storage device, partitions and formats it, then configures automatic mounting via fstab as a PBS datastore
- **`iSCSI_cleanup.sh`** - Comprehensive cleanup script that safely disconnects all iSCSI sessions, unmounts storage, removes fstab entries, and cleans up all traces

Both scripts are optimized specifically for Debian 13 with open-iscsi (the base OS for Proxmox Backup Server) and include robust error handling, colored output for better user experience, and detailed logging. The scripts use a simplified fstab-based approach for reliable automatic mounting. The mounted iSCSI LUNs can be directly configured as backup datastores in the Proxmox Backup Server web interface. This script is NOT compatible with Proxmox Backup Servers running as a LXC. You must run PBS as a full VM or baremetal to easily mount iSCSI LUNs.

### General Features

- **Debian 13 Optimized** - Specifically designed for Debian 13 with open-iscsi
- **Root Privilege Management** - Automatic root privilege checking
- **Colored Output** - Consistent color coding for status messages and errors
- **Input Validation** - Comprehensive validation of user inputs and system state
- **Safe Execution** - Uses `set -euo pipefail` for robust error handling

## Prerequisites

- Debian 13 (Trixie) - base OS for Proxmox Backup Server 4.0
- Root privileges
- open-iscsi package installed
- Target iSCSI server with CHAP authentication configured
- Proxmox Backup Server installation (for datastore configuration)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
apt update
apt install -y git
git clone https://github.com/DerekSeaman/iSCSI_mounting.git
cd iSCSI_mounting
```

2. Make scripts executable:

```bash
chmod +x iSCSI_mount.sh iSCSI_cleanup.sh
```

3. Install and configure open-iscsi:

```bash
# Install open-iscsi and update package list
apt install open-iscsi -y

# Load iSCSI kernel modules
modprobe iscsi_tcp
modprobe scsi_transport_iscsi

# Verify modules are loaded
lsmod | grep iscsi_tcp
modinfo iscsi_tcp

# Configure modules to load at boot
echo "iscsi_tcp" >> /etc/modules
echo "scsi_transport_iscsi" >> /etc/modules

# Configure automatic node startup
sed -i 's/node.startup = manual/node.startup = automatic/g' /etc/iscsi/iscsid.conf
```

4. Reboot the system:

```bash
reboot
```

## Usage

### Mounting iSCSI Storage

Run the mounting script as root:

```bash
./iSCSI_mounting/iSCSI_mount.sh
```

The script will prompt for:

- **Target IQN** (e.g., `iqn.2000-01.com.synology:DS923.Target-1.2c0d1f17e14`)
- **CHAP Username**
- **CHAP Password** (hidden input)
- **iSCSI Portal IP Address** (e.g., `192.168.2.100`)
- **Mount Path** (e.g., `/mnt/synology`)

### Example Session

```text
=== Combined iSCSI Connect and Mount Script ===
Enter target IQN: iqn.2000-01.com.synology:DS923.Target-1.2c0d1f17e14
Enter CHAP username: myuser
Enter CHAP password: [hidden]
Enter portal IP address: 192.168.2.100
Enter mount path: /mnt/synology

✓ iSCSI connection established
✓ Device /dev/sde detected and configured  
✓ Mount configured for immediate availability on boot
✓ Monitoring setup complete

Final disk usage for /mnt/synology:
Filesystem      Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
/dev/sde1       2.0T   24K  1.9T   1% /mnt/synology
```

**Next Steps**: After successful mounting, configure the mounted path (`/mnt/synology`) as a datastore in the Proxmox Backup Server web interface under **Datastores** → **Add Datastore**.

### Cleaning Up iSCSI Storage

To remove all iSCSI configurations and disconnect storage:

```bash
./iSCSI_cleanup.sh
```

**Warning**: This will disconnect ALL iSCSI sessions and may cause data loss. Ensure all data is saved before running.

## Script Workflow

### Mounting Process

1. **Service Verification** - Checks and starts iscsid service
2. **iSCSI Connection** - Connects to target with CHAP authentication and configures automatic startup
3. **Device Detection** - Automatically finds the new storage device
4. **Storage Preparation** - Partitions and formats the device with ext4
5. **fstab Configuration** - Adds UUID-based entry to /etc/fstab with systemd-optimized options
6. **Mount Activation** - Immediately mounts the filesystem and verifies operation
7. **Monitoring Setup** - Configures automatic session reconnection and mount restoration monitoring via cron

### Cleanup Process

1. **Discovery** - Identifies all active iSCSI sessions and devices
2. **fstab Cleanup** - Removes iSCSI entries from /etc/fstab with backup creation
3. **Storage Unmounting** - Safely unmounts all iSCSI filesystems
4. **Session Logout** - Disconnects from all iSCSI targets
5. **Configuration Removal** - Cleans up node configurations and databases
6. **Device Cleanup** - Forces removal of device entries
7. **File Cleanup** - Removes monitoring scripts, helper scripts, and logs
8. **Verification** - Confirms complete cleanup

## Generated Files

The mounting script creates several files for persistent configuration:

### fstab Configuration

- `/etc/fstab` - UUID-based mount entry with systemd-optimized options
- `/etc/fstab.backup.*` - Timestamped backup of original fstab

### Monitoring

- `/usr/local/bin/check-iscsi-session-[mountname].sh` - Session and mount monitoring script
- `/var/log/iscsi-monitor.log` - Monitoring log file
- Cron job entry for automated monitoring (every minute)

### Mount Configuration

- Partition mounted at specified path with UUID-based configuration
- ext4 filesystem optimized for backup storage
- Automatic mounting on boot via fstab with timeout protection
- Ready for Proxmox Backup Server datastore configuration

## Configuration Options

### Mount Behavior

The script configures **automatic mounting** via fstab with systemd enhancements:

- Storage is mounted automatically during system startup
- Uses `nofail` option to prevent boot failure if storage unavailable
- 30-second device timeout prevents boot hangs
- No manual intervention required after reboot

### Monitoring Frequency

- Session and mount monitoring runs every minute via cron
- Failed connections trigger automatic reconnection attempts
- Failed mounts trigger automatic mount restoration attempts
- All monitoring activity is logged for troubleshooting

## Proxmox Backup Server Integration

After successfully mounting the iSCSI storage using these scripts:

1. **Access PBS Web Interface** - Navigate to your Proxmox Backup Server web interface
2. **Add Datastore** - Go to **Datastores** → **Add Datastore**
3. **Configure Datastore**:
   - **Name**: Choose a descriptive name (e.g., "synology-backup")
   - **Backing Path**: Use the mount path from the script (e.g., `/mnt/synology`)
   - **GC Schedule**: Configure garbage collection as needed
4. **Verify Setup** - The datastore should show available space and be ready for backup jobs

The ext4 filesystem and fstab-based mount configuration are optimized for backup storage workloads and provide reliable, battle-tested performance for Proxmox Backup Server operations.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Device not detected after connection

- Verify iSCSI target is accessible and running
- Check CHAP credentials are correct
- Ensure no firewall blocking the connection
- Verify `node.startup=automatic` is configured

#### Mount not available after reboot

- Check fstab entry: `more /etc/fstab`
- Verify iSCSI session is active: `iscsiadm -m session`
- Check boot logs: `journalctl -b | grep -i iscsi`
- Test manual mount: `mount [mountpath]`
- Check monitoring logs: `tail /var/log/iscsi-monitor.log`
- Wait 1-2 minutes for automatic restoration (monitoring runs every minute)

#### Permission denied errors

- Ensure script is run as root
- Check mount point permissions after setup
- Verify filesystem is accessible: `ls -la [mountpath]`

### Log Locations

- **Boot logs**: `journalctl -b | grep -i iscsi`
- **Monitoring logs**: `/var/log/iscsi-monitor.log`
- **iSCSI service logs**: `journalctl -u iscsid`
- **fstab backups**: `/etc/fstab.backup.*`

### Manual Commands

Check mount status:

```bash
df -h | grep [mountpath]
```

```bash
lsblk -o NAME,TYPE,SIZE,FSTYPE,MOUNTPOINT
```

Check fstab entry:

```bash
more /etc/fstab
```

Check iSCSI sessions:

```bash
iscsiadm -m session
```

Test connectivity:

```bash
iscsiadm -m discovery -t sendtargets -p [portal-ip]
```

## Security Considerations

- **CHAP Passwords** - Stored in iSCSI node configuration files (readable by root only)
- **Authentication** - Scripts require root privileges for system modifications
- **Data Protection** - Always backup data before running cleanup script

## Compatibility

- **Operating System**: Debian 13 (Trixie) - Proxmox Backup Server 4.0 ISO
- **iSCSI Implementation**: open-iscsi
- **Init System**: systemd

The scripts are specifically optimized for this environment and may require modifications for other distributions.
